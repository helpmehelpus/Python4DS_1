# Python4DS_1
Coursework material from Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree - Part 1.

In this course, students are required to apply their Python skills - with specific focus on pandas and matplotlib - to analyse data from Bay Area Bike Share, a Californian company that offers bicycles at diverse locations across the cities of San Francisco, San Jose, Mountain View, Redwood City and Palo Alto.

This folder contains source data from CSV files, as well as the final analysys, and the corresponding source code.
